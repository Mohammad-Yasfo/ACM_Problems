1-Stacks
Stacks and queues are containers where items are retrieved according to the order of
insertion, independent of content. Stacks maintain last-in, first-out order. The abstract
operations on a stack include –
• Push(x,s) — Insert item x at the top of stack s.
• Pop(s) — Return (and remove) the top item of stack s.
• Initialize(s) — Create an empty stack.
• Full(s), Empty(s) — Test whether the stack can accept more pushes or pops,
respectively.

2-Queues
Queues maintain first-in, first-out order. This appears fairer than last-in, first-out, which
is why lines at stores are organized as queues instead of stacks. Decks of playing cards
can be modeled by queues, since we deal the cards off the top of the deck and add them
back in at the bottom. FIFO queues will be used in implementing breadth-first search
in graphs in Chapter 9.
The abstract operations on a queue include —
• Enqueue(x,q) — Insert item x at the back of queue q.
• Dequeue(q) — Return (and remove) the front item from queue q
• Initialize(q), Full(q), Empty(q) — Analogous to these operation on stacks.

3-Dictionaries
Dictionaries permit content-based retrieval, unlike the position-based retrieval of stacks
and queues. They support three primary operations –
• Insert(x,d) — Insert item x into dictionary d.
• Delete(x,d) — Remove item x (or the item pointed to by x) from dictionary d.
• Search(k,d) — Return an item with key k if one exists in dictionary d.

4-Priority Queues
Priority queues are data structures on sets of items supporting three operations –
• Insert(x,p) — Insert item x into priority queue p.
• Maximum(p) — Return the item with the largest key in priority queue p.
• ExtractMax(p) — Return and remove the item with the largest key in p.


5-2.1.5 Sets
Sets (or more strictly speaking subsets) are unordered collections of elements drawn
from a given universal set U. Set data structures get distinguished from dictionaries
because there is at least an implicit need to encode which elements from U are not in
the given subset.
The basic operations on subsets are —
• Member(x,S) — Is an item x an element of subset S?
• Union(A,B) — Construct subset A ∪ B of all elements in subset A or in subset
B.
• Intersection(A,B) — Construct subset A ∩ B of all elements in subset A and in
subset B.
• Insert(x,S), Delete(x,S) — Insert/delete element x into/from subset S.
